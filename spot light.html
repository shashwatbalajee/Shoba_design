              <h3>SOBHA's CSR arm hosts 28th edition of dowry-free wedding</h3>
              <p>
                "In its journey towards making meaningful impact on the lives of the underprivileged,
                SOBHA's Corporate Social Responsibility (CS) arm - Sri Kurumba Educational and
                Charitable Trust - recently hosted the 28th edition of the dowry-free social wedding at
                Palakkad, Kerala on June 17th, 2023
                The Trust organizes such social weddings twice a year. As part of the first lot of
                weddings in 2023, 17 couples tied the knot at the Sri Kurumba Kalyana Mandapam in
                Moolamkode. To mark the matrimonial ceremony, Mrs. Sobha Menon gifted each couple 4.5
                gold sovereign jewellery, along with basic resources such as clothes and utensils to
                enable the couples to embark on a new journey.
                To ensure a healthy and sustained marriage, like always, the Trust provided pre-
                marriage counselling to all couples and their parents. In addition, regular post
                marriage follow-ups and assistance will also be provided to the couples as required.
                The function was attended by distinguished guests, including Ms. R. Bindu, Minister for
                Higher Education and Social Justice; Mr. K. Krishnan Kutty, Minister for Electricity;
                Mr. K.E.
                Ismail (Former Minister for Revenue, Kerala Government); Mr. V.C. Kabeer (Former
                Minister for Health, Kerala Government); and Mr. K.D. Prasenan (MLA, Alathur Legislative
                Assembly).
                It also included a feast for 1000+ people.
                To date, the Trust has organized 684 dowry-free weddings."
